# Property Panel Component
Allow devs to easily add a Microsoft IDE-esk property panel to their web page using this JavaScript library.

It could have more features, but I specifically designed it for a project I'm working on. And it
is most important (of course) that it work for that!

Other features will be put in when I get to it. ðŸ˜›

Adding component library to page:
```
<script src=""></script>
```
